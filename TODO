BUGS

Zoom bug -- changing zoom causes rendering to fail
Mouse detection -- line detection is almost symmetrical around grid lines but not quite
Kind of becoming a mess -- refactor
Zoom breaks a lot of features
Event handling for column resizing is also a little bit broken

FIXED

[x] Header doesn't extend to top of page -- some text peeks out above the header
