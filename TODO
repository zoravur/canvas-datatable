BUGS

Kind of becoming a mess -- refactor

[x] Header doesn't extend to top of page -- some text peeks out above the header
[x] Zoom bug -- changing zoom causes rendering to fail
    - Always SCALE before TRANSLATING. (you want an affine transformation in terms of the offset + scale values)
    - Use cursor to 
[x] Mouse detection -- line detection is almost symmetrical around grid lines but not quite
[x] Event handling for column resizing is also a little bit broken
