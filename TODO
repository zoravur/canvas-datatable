BUGS

Kind of becoming a mess -- refactor
setCellInfo isn't always called before render -- this is because it's possible that only some fields are set in \_cellInfo,
so it's not fully initialized. Ensure setCellInfo is called before first render.
Currently widths are set by modifying this.config -- this.config should be readonly though

FIXED

[x] Header doesn't extend to top of page -- some text peeks out above the header
[x] Zoom bug -- changing zoom causes rendering to fail - Always SCALE before TRANSLATING. (you want an affine transformation in terms of the offset + scale values) - Use cursor to
[x] Mouse detection -- line detection is almost symmetrical around grid lines but not quite
[x] Event handling for column resizing is also a little bit broken
